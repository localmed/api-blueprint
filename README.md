# API Blueprint 
### API Design for Humans
API Blueprint is a documentation-oriented API description language. A couple of semantical assumptions over the plain [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

API Blueprint is perfect for designing your Web API and its comprehensive documentation but also for quick prototyping and collaboration. It is easy to learn and even easier to read; after all it is just a form Markdown.

## TL;DR
+ Web API description language
+ Pure Markdown
+ Designed for humans
+ Understandable by machines

## Getting started with API Blueprint
All it really takes to describe an endpoint of your API is write something like this: 

```md
# GET /message
+ Response 200 (text/plain)
    
        Hello World!
```
        
in your favorite Markdown editor. Now you can share and discuss this API in your API repository and let GitHub to render the API documentation so others can see it. 

Jump directly to the [API Blueprint Tutorial](Tutorial.md) or browse the [interactive examples](http://apiblueprint.org) to learn more about the API Blueprint syntax.

Describing your API is only the start. The API Blueprint can be used by variety of tools from interactive documentation and code generators to API testing tools thanks to its machine-friendly face:

```javascript
{
  "_version": "1.0",
  "metadata": {},
  "name": "",
  "description": "",
  "resourceGroups": [
    {
        ...
```

It is the task of the native API Blueprint [parser](https://github.com/apiaryio/snowcrash) or one of its [bindings](https://github.com/apiaryio/snowcrash#bindings) to "translate" the API Blueprint Markdown representation into a [machine friendly format – AST](https://github.com/apiaryio/snowcrash/wiki/API-Blueprint-AST-Media-Types).
